It was six men of Indostan 
    To learning much inclined, 
Who went to see the Elephant 
    (Though all of them were blind), 
That each by observation Might satisfy his mind.

The First approached the Elephant, 
    And happening to fall 
Against his broad and sturdy side, 
    At once began to bawl: â€œGod bless! but the Elephant 
Is very like a wall!â€?
