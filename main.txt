It was six men of Indostan 
    To learning much inclined, 
Who went to see the Elephant 
    (Though all of them were blind), 
That each by observation Might satisfy his mind.
=======
The First approached the Elephant, 
    And happening to fall 
Against his broad and sturdy side, 
    At once began to bawl: “God bless! but the Elephant 
Is very like a wall!”
