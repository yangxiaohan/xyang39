It was six men of Indostan 
    To learning much inclined, 
Who went to see the Elephant 
    (Though all of them were blind), 
That each by observation Might satisfy his mind.

The First approached the Elephant, 
    And happening to fall 
Against his broad and sturdy side, 
    At once began to bawl: â€œGod bless! but the Elephant 
Is very like a wall!â€?

The Second, feeling of the tusk, 
    Cried, â€œHo! what have we here 
So very round and smooth and sharp? 
    To me â€™tis mighty clear 
This wonder of an Elephant 
    Is very like a spear !â€ 

The third approached the animal, 
    And happening to take 
The squirming trunk within his hands, 
    Thus boldly up and spake: â€œI see,â€ quoth he, â€œthe Elephant 
Is very like a Snake!â€?

The Fourth reached out an eager hand, 
    And felt about the knee. 
â€œWhat most this wondrous beast is like 
    Is mighty plain,â€ quoth he; â€œ 
â€™Tis clear enough the Elephant 
    Is very like a tree!â€ 
=======
The Fifth who chanced to touch the ear, 
    Said: â€œEâ€™en the blindest man 
Can tell what this resembles most; 
    Deny the fact who can, 
This marvel of an 
    Elephant Is very like a fan!â€
